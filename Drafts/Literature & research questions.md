# Prior art

## Literature

**Importance of documentation**

- Communication
- Documenting the architecture is the crowning step to crafting it
- A well-documented architecture facilitates a shorter development time

**Efficiency of graphical documentation**

- where it is useful not useful

**Documentation usage in the industry**

- still more textual than graphical
- pain points: often out of date, hard/time consuming to create

**Navigation in graphs**

- Green, CD, Physics of notations, scalable graph exploration







# Research Questions

To what degree can semi-automatic generated graphical documentation of SwiftUI code improve the efficiency of component based UI development?

- Navigation:
  - Top-down: "Finding initial focus points" [^relevance]
    - **Speed**: Do programmers navigate faster to specific components' code?
    - **Accuracy**: Do programmers find the correct code of components?
  - Bottom-up: ?
